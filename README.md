What is this?
-------------
This is just a dumping ground for me to play with some web technologies.

Where'd that name come from?
----------------------------
I used a [project name generator](http://online-generator.com/name-generator/project-name-generator.php)
for two reasons:

1. I have no specific end goal for this project other than to tinker with a number of different technologies.
2. The technologies that will be incorporated into this project will be ever-shifting, thus I can't, for example, call it mongo-test-project or haml-test-project because I may not be using those technologies tomorrow.

So, what are you playing with?
------------------------------
At the moment:

* [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/)
* [HAML](http://haml-lang.com/)
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)

Cool. What's it look like?

I'm hosting this project [here](http://rusty-scarecrow.hosted.jmarcell.com/). No guarantee that it's working at any given moment.
