This is just a dumping ground for me to play with some web technologies. I used a [project name generator](http://online-generator.com/name-generator/project-name-generator.php)
for two reasons:

1. I have no specific end goal for this project other than to tinker with a number of different technologies.
2. The technologies that will be incorporated into this project will be ever-shifting, thus I can't, for example, call it mongo-test-project or haml-test-project because I may not be using those technologies tomorrow.
